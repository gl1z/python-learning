# PROJECT – Block Letters (ASCII Art)

# Full Name:
# Your Name Here

# Fun Fact:
# I once stayed up way too late debugging something
# that was just a missing quote.


# FIRST INITIAL (Example: T)

print("""
TTTTT
  T
  T
  T
  T
  T
  T
""")


# SECOND INITIAL (Example: S)

print("""
 SSSS
S
S
 SSS
    S
    S
SSSS
""")


# Optional – Both initials together
# (Just to see how spacing works)

print("""
TTTTT   SSSS
  T    S
  T    S
  T     SSS
  T        S
  T        S
  T    SSSS
""")


# PERSONAL NOTES

# - Triple quotes """ allow multi-line strings
# - Spacing matters a lot in ASCII art
# - The terminal prints exactly what you type
# - Even one extra space can change the shape
# - This was a fun intro to thinking visually in code
